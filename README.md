# My SignalWire Projects

This repo was made to contain the collection of scripts and applications I have built using SignalWire's APIs over the years.

The examples cover use cases for voice, messaging, and video in a variety of languages.

## ENV

To utilize .env for secrets, copy the example.env within the overarching language folder.

`cp .env.example .env`

## Credentials

Most of the scripts or applications require your SignalWire space domain, project ID, and API token. Those can be found [within your SignalWire Space](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/navigating-your-space#api) under the API tab.
