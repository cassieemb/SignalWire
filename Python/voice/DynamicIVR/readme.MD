# Overview 
This code shows how to can use a JSON-defined menu in order to easily create an IVR Phone System with Python & Flask. For a step-by-step walkthrough, visit our [developer portal](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/dynamic-ivr-using-json-menus/).


# What do I need to run this code?

You will need the Flask framework and the SignalWire [Python SDK](https://developer.signalwire.com/compatibility-api/sdks) downloaded.

You will need a SignalWire phone number and your API Credentials (**API Token**, **Space URL**, and **Project ID**) which can all be found in an easily copyable format within the **API** tab of your SignalWire portal. 

# How to Run Application

To run the application, execute `export FLASK_APP=app.py` then run `flask run`

You may need to use an SSH tunnel for testing this code if running on your local machine. â€“ we recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can learn more about how to use ngrok [here](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/docs/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok).
