- styling of whole app (color schemes, make formatting prettier, set consistent background colors (light grey maybe?))

## todo list

- pass http errors through to client side instead of letting page crash for bulk send (something wrong with number, sid not capable, etc) (use flash?)
- clear cookies and add login page to set .env file
  

- display daily opt out rate 
- click to see more details?
- progress bar for while bulk send is going and while message history is loading
