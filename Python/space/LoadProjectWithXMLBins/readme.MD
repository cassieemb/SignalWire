# What do I need to run this code?

This application doesn't require much - you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/), the [Flask framework](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_web_development_libraries/python_web_development_libraries_flask_framework.htm), and a [ngrok tunnel](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/docs/how-to-test-webhooks-with-ngrok) to reach your localhost or server to host it on. 

# How to Run Application 

To run the application, execute `export FLASK_APP=main.py` then run `flask run`.

You may need to use an SSH tunnel for testing this code â€“ we recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). After starting the tunnel, you can use the URL you receive from `ngrok` in your webhook configuration for your phone number.
